# Zelda Tracker

Zelda Tracker is a HTML5/CSS/JS-based application for tracking progress of one
or more racers during a Zelda 1 race. It is designed with readability, 
easy usability, and scalability in mind.

## Latest Version

Production-ready releases will be hosted at [my personal site]
(http://bassguitarbill.rocks/zelda-tracker/). A cutting-edge, development
version will be hosted at [the .IO of this repo]
(https://bassguitarbill.github.io/zelda-tracker/). I can't guarantee this will
work 100% of the time, there are at time of writing no tests in this module.
